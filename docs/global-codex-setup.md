# Configure Codex Globally

This note explains the user-level Codex setup that turns this repository into a one-time installer instead of a per-session dependency.

This page documents the `1.1.0` runtime layout.

The goal is simple:

- install once
- use the GodMode workflow in any workspace
- keep a clean split between global runtime and local project capabilities

## Recommended layer model

The current Codex documentation supports this structure:

- personal guidance in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- personal technical defaults in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- personal custom agents in `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`
- personal reusable skills in `~/.agents/skills/`
- repo rules in `AGENTS.md`
- repo defaults in `.codex/config.toml`
- project-specific custom agents in `.codex/agents/*.toml`
- repo-specific reusable procedures in `.agents/skills/`

Discovery rules that matter:

- Codex reads global guidance from `AGENTS.override.md` when present, otherwise `AGENTS.md`
- project guidance is layered from the project root down to the current working directory
- in each project directory, `AGENTS.override.md` takes precedence over `AGENTS.md`
- files closer to the current working directory win because they appear later in the merged instruction chain
- `.codex/config.toml` is loaded only for trusted projects
- same-name skills are not AGENTS-style merged; keep skill names focused and avoid accidental duplicates

## Fast start by platform

This repository ships a reproducible global setup under:

- `templates/global-codex/AGENTS.md`
- `templates/global-codex/config.toml`
- `templates/global-codex/agents/`
- `templates/global-codex/skills/`
- `scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh`
- `scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.ps1`

Apply the matching installer for your platform:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\apply-global-codex-setup.ps1
```

These installers do five things:

- installs `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and `~/.codex/config.toml` from the repo templates
- installs the GodMode agents to `~/.codex/agents/`
- installs the GodMode skills to `~/.agents/skills/`
- ensures `~/.codex/playwright-output/isolated` exists
- adds the current repo path as a trusted project

It also archives prior install snapshots under `~/.codex/backups/` instead of
leaving `*.backup-*` files or directories inside the active agent and skill
discovery roots. That matters because in-place backups can surface as duplicate
skills or agents in Codex.

It also replaces the `__CODEX_HOME__` placeholder inside the config template so the Playwright output path stays portable.

To verify the result:

macOS/Linux:

```bash
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh --check
```

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\apply-global-codex-setup.ps1 -Check
```

## Upgrade from earlier releases

Version `1.1.0` adds `$godmode-prototype` and the prototype-mode templates.
If you are upgrading from the `0.2.x` line, the `1.0.0` runtime changes also
apply: expanded agents and skills, pinned CI/security coverage, and the
`gpt-5.5` default model.

Use this sequence:

```bash
git pull --ff-only origin main
./scripts/check-local-env.sh
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh --check
```

On Windows, use the PowerShell installer and `-Check` command instead of the shell script.

The installer creates timestamped backups before replacing existing files or directories. After the upgrade, `~/.codex/agents/` should contain 16 agent manifests and `~/.agents/skills/` should contain the ten skills shipped by this repo.

If you maintain hand-edited personal guidance in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` or `~/.codex/config.toml`, inspect the generated backup files and reapply personal edits intentionally.

This bootstrap repository intentionally does not keep the packaged runtime under repo-local `.codex/agents/` or `.agents/skills/`. Those are official project discovery paths; keeping the global package source there would make Codex show duplicate project and personal skills when this repository is open after installation.

## Minimal global files

Create the Codex home directory if needed:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex
```

Global guidance belongs in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.

Example:

```md
# ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

## Default working style
- Work only inside the currently opened project.
- Keep diffs small, safe, and buildable.
- Do not touch unrelated files.

## Execution flow
- For non-trivial tasks: Research -> Plan -> Build -> Validate -> Release Summary.
- Start with a governance preflight and identify the repo's release and documentation rules before editing versioned artifacts.
- Before editing, report repo root, current branch, touched files, and expected impact.

## Safety gates
- Never commit unless I explicitly say yes.
- Never push unless I explicitly say yes.
- Never force-push.
```

Global technical defaults belong in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

Example:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
web_search = "cached"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
writable_roots = []
network_access = false
```

Why this is a good baseline:

- `gpt-5.5` is the current frontier default for coding and professional work
- `approval_policy = "on-request"` keeps risky actions interactive
- `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` allows project edits without full machine access
- `web_search = "cached"` is conservative by default

Changing the model default is a release-impacting behavior change. Keep it documented in `CHANGELOG.md` and verify the installed config after applying the setup script.

## Global profiles

The repo templates install four user-level profiles:

- `swiftui` for Apple platform work
- `web` for React, Next.js, and Node.js work
- `flutter` for Flutter and Dart work
- `review` for review and audit sessions

Examples:

```bash
codex --profile swiftui
codex --profile web
codex --profile flutter
codex --profile review
```

These profiles are intentionally thin. The workflow itself comes from the globally installed `AGENTS.md`, custom agents, and skills.

For greenfield work, the installed skills also include
`greenfield-bootstrap` so a new repo can establish local rules before the
rest of the workflow fans out.

## Installed runtime layout

After running the installer, the user-level runtime looks like this:

```text
~/.codex/
  AGENTS.md
  config.toml
  agents/
    researcher.toml
    task_classifier.toml
    preflight_runner.toml
    architect.toml
    api_guardian.toml
    builder.toml
    validator.toml
    tester.toml
    scribe.toml
    github_manager.toml
    runtime_platform.toml
    workflow_design.toml
    workspace_governance.toml
    quality_operations.toml
    docs_dx.toml
    ci_security_guardian.toml

~/.agents/
  skills/
    godmode-workflow/
    godmode-prototype/
    godmode-debug/
    godmode-review/
    godmode-departments/
    greenfield-bootstrap/
    apple-platforms/
    web-platforms/
    flutter-dart/
    release-manager/
```

The first eight agents remain the role-centric baseline. The department-oriented agents are optional additions for larger multi-domain runs and do not mean every task should fan out by default.

Packaged agents pin their model and reasoning effort in their source TOML manifests. Classification and implementation run on `gpt-5.5` / `high`; most governance, utility, validation, and advisory roles run on `gpt-5.4` or `gpt-5.4-mini` with `medium` reasoning.

The matching skill split is:

- `godmode-workflow` as the primary entry skill for most runs
- `godmode-prototype` as the local-only fast lane for throwaway spikes
- `godmode-departments` as the explicit opt-in layer for department-mode routing
- `godmode-debug` as the focused companion for reproduce -> isolate -> fix work
- `godmode-review` as the focused companion for findings-first assessment work

That is the important UX boundary: users do not need this repository open in every new Codex session after installation.

## Runtime roles

Phase 1 of `$godmode-workflow` uses these ingestion and discovery routes:

| Step | Route | Model pin | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `workspace_governance` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | inspect workspace shape and governance surface |
| 2 | `$greenfield-bootstrap` | Tier 3 behavior | bootstrap missing repo-local governance with the existing skill |
| 3 | `task_classifier` | `gpt-5.5` / `high` | classify the task and choose the smallest viable team |
| 4 | `preflight_runner` | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `medium` | run preflight checks and initialize workflow state when needed |
| 5 | `researcher` | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `medium` | verify sources or discover repository facts when more evidence is needed |

The runtime installs these core agents:

| Agent | Model pin | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `researcher` | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `medium` | read-only research, source verification, and repo discovery |
| `architect` | `gpt-5.5` / `high` | read-only plan, boundary, and risk design |
| `api_guardian` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | read-only API, schema, CLI, config, and user-visible contract review |
| `builder` | `gpt-5.5` / `high` | single normal implementation writer |
| `validator` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | read-heavy consistency, static, and structural validation |
| `tester` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | executable checks and focused runtime verification |
| `scribe` | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `medium` | docs, changelog, and release-note work after gates pass |
| `github_manager` | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `medium` | branch, PR, release, and governance framing |

It also installs optional department agents for large cross-domain runs:

| Agent | Model pin | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime_platform` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | runtime defaults, sandboxing, tools, and environment concerns |
| `workflow_design` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | orchestration procedures, skill boundaries, and handoff artifacts |
| `workspace_governance` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | workspace shape, AGENTS layering, release law, and local project rules |
| `quality_operations` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | validation plans, install checks, smoke paths, and eval-oriented checks |
| `docs_dx` | `gpt-5.4-mini` / `medium` | public docs, setup guidance, prompts, and developer experience |
| `ci_security_guardian` | `gpt-5.4` / `medium` | GitHub Actions, CODEOWNERS, pinned actions, and repository security posture |

Department agents are advisory lanes. They do not replace the default `researcher` -> `architect` -> `builder` -> `validator` and `tester` route.

## Runtime skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `godmode-workflow` | the normal non-trivial task loop |
| `godmode-prototype` | local-only rapid prototyping with watermarks and a migration checklist |
| `godmode-debug` | reproduce -> isolate -> fix -> re-test work |
| `godmode-review` | findings-first review with no edits unless requested |
| `godmode-departments` | optional routing for cross-domain work |
| `greenfield-bootstrap` | create local governance before parallel work in empty or undocumented repos |
| `apple-platforms` | SwiftUI, macOS, and iOS guidance |
| `web-platforms` | React, Next.js, and Node.js guidance |
| `flutter-dart` | Flutter and Dart guidance |
| `release-manager` | release impact, changelog, and PR framing |

## Repo layout

Recommended structure:

```text
repo-root/
  AGENTS.md
  .codex/
    config.toml
    agents/
  .agents/
    skills/
```

Why the split matters:

- `AGENTS.md` defines durable guidance
- `.codex/config.toml` defines technical defaults
- `.codex/agents/*.toml` defines role-specific custom agents
- `.agents/skills/` stores reusable procedures
- workspace-local files remain project-scoped guidance or capabilities when a project needs them

In this bootstrap repository, packaged global runtime sources live under `templates/global-codex/agents/` and `templates/global-codex/skills/` instead. Downstream projects should still use `.codex/agents/` and `.agents/skills/` when they intentionally need project-local agents or skills.

## Why not a giant start prompt

The durable pattern is:

- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` for personal defaults
- `~/.codex/config.toml` for personal technical defaults
- `~/.codex/agents/*.toml` for personal custom agents
- `~/.agents/skills/` for personal reusable workflow skills
- repo `AGENTS.md` for team or project rules
- repo `.codex/config.toml` for technical repo defaults
- repo `.codex/agents/*.toml` for project roles
- repo `.agents/skills/` for reusable procedures
- this repo's `templates/global-codex/agents/` and `templates/global-codex/skills/` for package sources that should not be discovered as project-local duplicates

This repository keeps prompts short on purpose because the real behavior belongs in those layers.

`AGENTS.md` files form a layered instruction chain. Skills are discovered capabilities with progressive disclosure: Codex sees metadata first and reads the full `SKILL.md` only when it selects the skill.

## Validation and smoke tests

Before publishing a release or telling users to update, run:

```bash
git diff --check
./scripts/check-local-env.sh
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh --check
```

For installer changes, verify a clean target:

```bash
tmp_root="$(mktemp -d)"
tmp_codex="$tmp_root/.codex"
tmp_skills="$tmp_root/.agents/skills"
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh \
  --codex-home "$tmp_codex" \
  --user-skills-home "$tmp_skills" \
  --no-trust-project
./scripts/apply-global-codex-setup.sh --check \
  --codex-home "$tmp_codex" \
  --user-skills-home "$tmp_skills" \
  --no-trust-project
```

That smoke test proves a first-time install can create the full runtime without relying on this machine's existing `~/.codex` or `~/.agents` state.

## Smoke-test the install

After applying the installer, start Codex in any workspace and use a minimal skill-first prompt such as:

```text
$godmode-workflow

Goal: <goal>
Context:
- <files, errors, constraints>
Done when:
- <finish condition>
```

Add companion skills such as `$godmode-departments`, `$godmode-debug`,
`$godmode-review`, `$greenfield-bootstrap`, or stack-specific skills only
when the task actually needs them. Use `$godmode-prototype` instead of
`$godmode-workflow` for local-only throwaway spikes. The prompt should not
refer to this repository as a required runtime dependency.

## Notes about Local vs Worktree

If you want to work directly in the checked-out repository, use `Local`.

Current Codex documentation makes these points explicit:

- new threads can be started in `Worktree`
- threads can move between `Local` and `Worktree`
- automations can run in either mode
- Codex-managed worktrees live under `$CODEX_HOME/worktrees`

I have not seen a documented global setting that forces every new session to use `Local` automatically. That is an inference from the currently reviewed docs, not an explicit negative statement from OpenAI.
