# ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

## Default working style

- Work only inside the currently opened workspace unless I explicitly ask for a separate clone or worktree.
- Inspect the current workspace first. Do not assume it is a Git repo, app, package, monorepo, or empty folder until verified.
- Keep diffs small, safe, and buildable.
- Do not touch unrelated files.
- Prefer official framework docs when guidance is version-sensitive.
- Record assumptions briefly when repo rules are unclear.

## Execution flow

- For non-trivial work: Research -> Plan -> Build -> Validate -> Release Summary.
- Start with a governance preflight: inspect the nearest `AGENTS.md`, repo-root `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR template, and any versioning, release, or contract docs that control the touched scope.
- If the workspace is empty, newly initialized, or missing repo-local governance, bootstrap a local project constitution before parallel implementation work.
- Before editing, report workspace root, current branch if present, touched files, and expected impact when that is not already obvious.
- Run only the checks that match the changed scope.
- Use the installed global workflow, custom agents, and skills by default.
- If the current workspace provides its own `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/agents/`, or `.agents/skills/`, treat them as local project guidance or capabilities and adapt to them instead of ignoring them.
- If repo rules are split across docs instead of a root `AGENTS.md`, treat those docs as binding once discovered.

## Global workflow

- Prefer the GodMode loop for non-trivial work.
- Available global agents: `workspace_governance`, `task_classifier`, `preflight_runner`, `researcher`, `architect`, `api_guardian`, `builder`, `validator`, `tester`, `scribe`, `github_manager`.
- Optional department agents: `runtime_platform`, `workflow_design`, `workspace_governance`, `quality_operations`, `docs_dx`, `ci_security_guardian`.
- Available global skills: `godmode-workflow`, `godmode-prototype`, `godmode-departments`, `godmode-debug`, `godmode-review`, `greenfield-bootstrap`, `apple-platforms`, `web-platforms`, `flutter-dart`, `release-manager`.

## Profile intents

- `swiftui`: prioritize Apple platform guidance, SwiftUI state ownership, and `xcodebuild`-based validation.
- `web`: prioritize React purity, Next.js App Router rules, Node.js contract clarity, and version-sensitive web docs.
- `flutter`: prioritize analyzer cleanliness, repository boundaries, unidirectional data flow, and `flutter test` / `dart analyze`.
- `review`: default to review mode with findings first, severity ordering, and file or line references before summaries.

## Stack defaults

- SwiftUI: keep a single source of truth, use `@State` only for transient UI state, use bindings for child edits, and keep business logic out of views.
- React / Next.js: prefer Server Components by default in App Router projects, keep client boundaries explicit, and avoid using effects for normal derived data flow.
- Node.js: keep public entry points explicit, centralize configuration loading, and avoid hidden side effects during module import.
- Flutter / Dart: keep widgets presentation-focused, keep repositories as the data source of truth, prefer unidirectional data flow, and treat analyzer output as correctness.

## Git safety

- Classify changes as major, minor, patch, or none.
- Do not start multi-agent parallel delivery in a greenfield repo until a repo-root `AGENTS.md` or equivalent local governance scaffold exists.
- Before editing `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, release notes, or change fragments, determine the repo's release law.
- Only update `[Unreleased]` when the repo explicitly uses that model for unreleased work.
- If the repo uses change fragments or release-managed versioning, follow that system instead of editing `VERSION` or `CHANGELOG.md` during normal feature work.
- Suggest Conventional Commit style titles when preparing commits.
- Never commit or push without explicit approval.
- Never force-push a shared branch.
- Never rewrite shared history.
